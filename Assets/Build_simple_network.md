## The Mission

![](https://poulette.herokuapp.com/assets/img/hackers-poulette-logo.png)

[Hackers Poulette](http://estelle.daubry.be/projet/becode/formulaire/index.php#home) a young startup that has just been created calls on your services to begin the installation of their infrastructure. 

For now, there are only three people working on it, and all on the same set. But Robert Tappan Morris, the CEO, insists on the fact that Hackers Poulette is bound to grow, that the ambitions of the startup are great. So he wants an installation that is easily scalable. All three hosts must also be connected to the internet.

**Addressing table :**

| Devices | LAN | IP | Mask |
|---------|-----|----|------|
| PC-Robert | Eth | 192.168.1.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 
| PC-Camille | Eth | 192.168.1.11 | 255.255.255.0 |
| PC-Renaud | Eth | 192.168.1.12 | 255.255.255.0 |

**Resource Requirements :**
- 1 switch (Cisco 2960 with Cisco IOS version 15.0(2) image lanbasek9 or similar)
- 3 PCs (Windows 10)
- Three Ethernet cables


## Mission objectives 
You will create a simple network with three hosts and a switch. You will apply IP addressing to the computers to allow communication between these three devices. Use the ping utility to verify connectivity between the hosts.

**Goals :**
* to be able to create a simple network
* to be able to configure interconnectivity between hosts
* to be able to connect hosts to the internet

### Must-have features

Use Cisco Packet Tracer to design your infrastructure.

### Nice-to-have features

Write a report with the configuration done on the hosts.


## Deliverables
1. Publish your pka file on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the readme file:
	- What, Why, When, How, Who.
	- Pending things to do
	- It must contain a link to the "live" version. The "live" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.
3. Publish the link to the "live" version on your startup's Discord's channel.
